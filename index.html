    <p>Greece has the longest coastline in Europe and is the southernmost country in Europe. The mainland has rugged mountains, forests, and lakes, but the country is well known for it's thousands of islands. Whether you want to explore a new city, soak up the sun on a quiet beach, explore the rich history of an ancient civilization or (if you love food as much as I do) enjoy the Mediterreanean cuisine, <em> Greece has something for everyone!</em></p>

    <!-- BRIEF HISTORY OF GREECE-->

    <container>
<div class="p2"
      <p>Ancient Greece was a civilization that dominated much of the Mediterranean thousands of years ago. At its peak under Alexander the Great, ancient Greece ruled much of Europe and western Asia. The Greeks came before the Romans and much of the Roman culture was influenced by the Greeks. Ancient Greece formed the foundation of much of Western culture today. Everything from government, philosophy, science, mathematics, art, literature, and even sports was impacted by the ancient Greeks.
